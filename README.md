# vopo

Initial token design on a smart contract. This is for the prototype built at ETHDenver.

# Overview of Project

We intend to design a non-invasive interface for verification of fake news through a tokenized, blockchain platform. 

# Overview of Token Design

Our platform uses two different tokens - Vote tokens and View tokens. Vote tokens denote the power in our system and are capped in their supply. They're staked when creating content on our platform, be it commenting or voting. This ensures that only quality content will appear on our platform. Contributions to our platform will earn view tokens.

View tokens are uncapped in their supply and are required for viewing. This solves the free rider problem inherent in other platforms (Reddit, Twitter etc)
